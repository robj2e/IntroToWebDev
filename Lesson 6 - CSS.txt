HTML is the content

CSS is the style, CSS determines how the HTML looks

CSS is a collection of rules. If certain rules are met, then a style is added to it.

Small snippet advice on course

when writing CSS files add 

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

Puts entire page in border box way of doing things, not content box which is old and outdated.

CSS shortcuts

div{
  margin-top: 50px;

}

Advice:

Always style using classes, styling with ID can be a problem later on when it comes to 
specificity issues. Specificity being what CSS property takes precedence when
multiple styles are conflicting on the same section.

Multiple classes can be used when defining div's etc.

Say you had 3 boxes, you could have a box class and a first, second, and third class.

You could style box to apply to all
You could then style .box.first to apply CSS to a specific item

CSS - DOCUMENT FLOW

CSS has a concept called float.
You can have divs "float" next to each other instead of each on a new line.
The browser will try to fit as many divs next to each other until there isn't any room, then it'll wrap to the next line.
